### ReceitasBackSpringBoot

This is the back-end repository for the Recipes Project for an OOP college class. It is built with Spring Boot and serves as an API to manage and provide recipe data to the front-end.

#### Features

- **Spring Boot**: The backend is developed using Spring Boot.
- **REST API**: Provides endpoints to fetch and manage recipe data.
- **JSON Data Storage**: Stores recipe data in JSON files.
- **OOP Principles**: Implements Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

#### Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven

**Installation**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexoliveiramartins/ReceitasBackSpringBoot.git
   cd ReceitasBackSpringBoot
   ```

2. Build the project with Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. The API should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

**API Endpoints**

- `GET /receitas`: Fetch all recipes.
- `GET /receitas/{id}`: Fetch a specific recipe by ID.
- `GET /receitas/pais`: Fetch a specific recipe by country.

**Project Structure**

- `src/main/java/`: Contains the Java source code.
  - `controllers/`: REST controllers.
  - `services/`: Business logic and service classes. 

#### Usage

- **API Clients**: Use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the API.
- **Integration with Front-End**: The front-end React application consumes this API to display recipe data.
